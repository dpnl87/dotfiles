2015-02-25 22:15:56	dirtygonzo	hey guys, having a weird issue.  When I try and spin up a new machine everything goes well until the chef client tries to register with my server, and i get this error.  ERROR: SSL Validation failure connecting to host: x.x.x.x - SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed.  I had a very similar error early on with my knife client, however that was fixed by running 'knife fetch ssl

2015-02-26 10:39:59	kinlo	I can disable ohai plugins by putting the line OFhai::Config[:disabled_plugins] = ["GCE"] in my /etc/chef/client.rb but somehow it doesn't seem to work.  The gce plugin blocks for a timeout due to dns issues, and I can't seem to get my chef-runs to run faster this way
2015-02-26 10:40:32	kinlo	any ideas on how to debug this?   is there a way to run ohai with certain plugins disabled to debug this first?

2015-02-26 11:02:28	@jonlives	kinlo: basically ohai 7 introduced the "Ohai.plugin(:Name)" block in plugin files (http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/04/ohai-new-ohai-plugins.html) - it's that name that you need to specify in disabled plugins in ohai 7 and newer.

2015-02-26 11:03:26	@jonlives	kinlo: the thing is the old format name of 'gce' isn't causing an error, it just doesn't match the name of the plugin, which is :GCE, per https://github.com/chef/ohai/blob/master/lib/ohai/plugins/gce.rb#L19

2015-02-26 11:26:57	rmoriz	what's the 2015 status of provisioning macs with chef? ;)
2015-02-26 11:27:26	rmoriz	especially "headless" macs that are going to be used for CI purposes (XCode and stuff)
2015-02-26 11:27:53	jbellone	rmoriz: You're booting them on VMware?
2015-02-26 11:28:12	rmoriz	jbellone: is that required?

2015-02-26 11:29:49	rmoriz	jbellone: we have some colocated mac minis @ datacenter. afaik the team can re-install them manually for us. however we don't really want to run everything in a VM on top for speed (we currently do)

2015-02-26 11:31:08	vanz	Hi! I am trying to install chef-provisioning gem using the embedded gem in chef. But the following error happends: https://gist.github.com/guilhermesft/6fc00b6525b11699c802. If I use the "normal" gem I can install the chef-provisioning without toubles.
2015-02-26 11:32:09	vanz	how you can see in the gist, is a compiler error in a dependency.
2015-02-26 11:32:10	rmoriz	jbellone: running multiple jenkins-slaves under different osx users should work without having to virtualize everything. However it does limit the flexibility in different versions

2015-02-26 11:50:41	tymik	hello, i'd like to ask a short question that i haven't quickly found an answer: is chef able to summon a brand new virtual machine just like vagrant does or would I need to use them both paralelly?

2015-02-26 11:58:15	workmad3	tymik: you'd typically use both... but you can do things like set up chef on the host with recipes that can spin-up new VMs using vagrant/virtualbox/etc based on conditions in the recipe, and those new VMs can then be managed with separate chef cookbooks
